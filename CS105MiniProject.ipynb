    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In wanting to figure out in general how various aspects of a student’s home environment go on to affect their employment and school performance, we performed 3 different tests: Comparing what kind of people participants lived with and whether or not they work, students who work on campus and their roommates majors, and the number of people participants lived with and the participant’s GPA. However, using chi-squared tests and pearson correlation, we discovered that none of our hypotheses had any correlation with it. But from here we can delve deeper into our hypothesis, for example why did working not affect student’s GPA’s in the first quarter? What are other potential factors as to why that was the case? In addition, Freshmen were found to not work at major related jobs, whereas juniors were the most likely to work at a major related job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though none of our hypotheses were proven to be true, we still learned a lot about the data given to us and we can use it to further more questions and assumptions later down the line.\n"
